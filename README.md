# "Deep Learning - From Basics to Practice" by Andrew Glassner

## This book is no longer available. 

There's a *much revised and better* version of the book available now, in both 
electronic and paper forms! Called **Deep Learning: A Visual Approach**,
you can find it on Amazon at https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B085BVWXNS

The materials here are preserved as an archive for those who
own the previous, Kindle-only edition of the book.

# In This Directory

   This directory holds files that aren't figures or notebooks.
   
   * `DL-layer-icons.ai` The icons I use in the book for deep learning layers. The file is stored in the legacy Adobe Illustrator CC format, so it should be readable on any version of Illustrator from then on.
   * `DL-layer-icons.png` A 300 dpi image version of the AI file, for those without Illustrator.


# About the Notebooks 

  Only three chapters in the book contain explicit code. Chapter 15 discusses
  the Scikit-Learn library, and Chapters 23 and 24 discuss the Keras library. All of
  the code in these chapters is in Python, and is provided in Jupyter notebooks.
  
  Most other chapters in the book contain at least some figures that were generated
  procedurally using Python. Those chapters also have associated notebooks which are
  available here. Those notebooks are not part of the book itself, but are offered 
  as a kind of "behind the scenes" look at how the figures were made for those who
  want to dig into the process. These notebooks are only lightly documented.
  
  Because of their role as learning materials, all of the code in these notebooks
  was written to emphasize clarity over all other stylistic concerns. This means
  that much of it can be shortened, and probably made faster as well. Feel free
  to dig in, optimize, convert to other languages, or otherwise play with the code.  
  
  All the notebooks are released under the MIT license. Informally, you're free to 
  do pretty much anything with the code, including using it in your own projects,
  or even including it in commercial projects, as long as you keep my copyright
  along with the code. While I strove for accuracy and correctness, there is no 
  warranty that the code is bug-free or fit for any purpose.
  
  Some notebooks work with images. The images I used in the book are included
  with the notebooks. See the section below on Figures for details on their
  licensing, and see the book for the URL where each image may be found. All images
  without an explicit citation in the book are by the author, and are released
  under the MIT license.

# About the Figures 

  The book is illustrated with roughly 1000 original figures. Most were drawn
  by the author in Adobe Illustrator. A few were drawn in Photoshop. All 
  are available here in PNG format.
  
  Most of these images are saved at high resolution (300 dpi or better), so
  they are appropriate for presentations and talks even when projected
  to large size.
  
  All of these figures are released under the MIT license, like the code. This
  means you're free to use them any way you like, as long as you keep the 
  copyright associated with them somehow. Use them for your classes,
  reports, papers, presentations, whatever you like!
  
  You're not required to attribute me or the book if you use these images, 
  but I'd appreciate it if you would. 
  
  Some figures include photographs. Many of these are by the author. All other
  photos are from Wikiart, Wikimedia, or Pixabay. The book provides a citation
  and URL to the source of each of these images. The first two sites state that
  their images are in the public domain. All images selected from Pixabay are 
  labeled as released under the Creative Commons CC0 license, and explicitly
  state, "Free for commercial use. No attribution required."
  
  To help you better sort through and choose figures, thumbnails for all 
  the figures are available.
